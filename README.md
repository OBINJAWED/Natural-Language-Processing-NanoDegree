## Projects:

### Project 1: 

#### Build a Part of Speech Tagging Model. 
Used several techniques, including table lookups, n-grams, and Hidden Markov Models, to tag parts of speech
in sentences, and compared their performances.

### Project 2: 

#### Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline.
The pipeline accepts English text as input and returns the French translation.

### Project 3: 

#### Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline.
The model converts raw audio into feature representations, which are then turned into transcribed text.
